            <h2><important>Problem Discription</important></h2>
            <h4>There are many delicious foods in this world, but one of the most famous is the great coned ice-cream.
            It is famous because of the tastiness of the ice-cream covered cone, but there is always an issue many forgotten 
            – how to ensure that ice-cream is filling in the entire ice-cream cone. This is a problem in our day to day life,
            everyone wants every bit of their ice cream filled in the ice-cream cone, filling the entire cone can make sure
            that you can have the best experience in the ice-cream serve. but this missing part of the cone being empty can 
            really frustrate the serve, think about last time you eating cone ice-cream, but the bottom the ice-cream cone 
            is filled with air, when you finished the ice-cream on the top all you see is an empty cone.  Andrew discovered 
            this issue a long time ago because he loves to eat ice-cream. He was using a spoon to get ice cream down to the
            bottom, but because of the fragile nature of the cone, the bottom broke off. This product solves this problem as
            a new reliable, easy, and cheap lazy alternative to carefully putting ice cream into the cone. This product is made 
            for all lovers of ice cream that use the wafer cones. Our intention is to make eating ice cream easier and faster.</h4>
            
            <h2><important>Research Summary</important></h2>
            <h4>The idea began when Andrew was absent for two days over the week when this project first began. At that moment 
            he thought ‘I am not passing this’. So he went and ate some ice cream, to feel better of the situation. When he went 
            to scoop some ice cream into the bottom of the wafer cone, the bottom of the cone broke off. He thought to himself 
            well this day couldn't get any worse. When he went to clean the mess of the  cone and the idea hits him – ‘I can make
            getting ice cream into the bottom half of the cone easier!’ At first, the idea was to make a cylinder that can be
            pushed into an ice cream container, but then the problem arose with that idea. These problems were : when the ice-cream 
            is in the cylinder it is difficult to (usually it just made a circular outline in the ice cream). It was hard to get 
            it back out after scooping ice cream, and it was also hard to get the object in as ice cream hardens after in a refrigerator.
            Solutions were : sharp edges where added at the bottom to cut easier into the ice cream, and a handle was created at
            the top so it could be easily twisted into the ice cream. Now this product is a fully functional piece that works on 
            getting ice cream out of a container, and into a wafer ice cream cone. There is an adjustable part to get ice cream 
            from 2 inches to 1 inch. Sharp edges (but not too sharp to cut yourself on) at the bottom and a handle at the top. These 
            if manufactured should be relatively cheap and quick to be made. But some drawbacks to this product, it may be a little
            hard to get ice cream out of it when you have it in. This is included to be a further thing that could be fixed or
            implemented for the future evolution of this product.</h4>
            
            <h2><important>Solution Summary</important></h2>
            <h4>This product’s purpose is to get ice cream that is apparent and has been mentioned. Since this product is a 
            cylinder shape, it can cut out a perfect cylinder shape  of ice cream which can be put into the the wafer cone 
            and then you may roll a ball of ice cream to put on top of the cone after you have used this product. But this 
            does have some problems as it it hard to get the ice cream out of the product after it has been used. This could
            be changed in a newer version of the product but as of now it can not be changed. A lever mechanism may be 
            implemented to counteract this problem.</h4>
